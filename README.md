Here are the specific features of this project:

* AngularJS front end experience that allows a user to create a task.
* Task inputs are inside of a form to allow submitting via enter key.
* When the task is created, it is stored in a database (MongoDB).
* Whenever a task is created the front end refreshes to show all tasks that need to be completed.
* Each task has an option to 'Complete' or 'Delete'.
* When a task is complete, its visual representation changes to strikethrough on the front end .
* Whether or not a task is complete is also stored in the database.
* Deleting a task removes it both from the Front End as well as the Database.
* Uses Bootstrap for styling button and input groups.
* Uses SweetAlert to create a popup warning dialog when deleting a task.
* Uses Font Awesome for graphic buttons.
* Contains basic front-end input validation when creating a task.
* Users can input text to filter tasks by task item or category.
* Completed tasks are automatically moved to the bottom of the list.
